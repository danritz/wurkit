        Almost no buildings adapt well. They’re designed not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, administered not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all <a href="praesent-pharetra-tellus.html" class="more">●●●</a> <!-- buildings (except monuments) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly. -->

      The dysfunctional process of construction produces maladaptive buildings. It is far less expensive to adapt software to its environment. Unfortunately, without changing how we manage software, it will likely remain rigid. It will likely continue to resist adapting to its environment.

        Along with their practical durability, they show age honestly and elegantly, as successive washings fade and shrink them to perfect fit and rich texture. Ingenious techniques to simulate aging of denim come and go, but the basic indigo 502s, copper riveted, carry for decades. This is highly evolved design. Are there blue-jeans buildings among us? How does design honestly honor time?

      Are there blue-jeans applications among us? Great design requires an astonishing amount of use and adaptation. Most will create an adequate pair of blue-jeans, then create an adequate jacket. Then adequate shorts. Nothing is ever great. Adequate ideas fall in and out of favor — distracting us from the chance to be great.

      <p>
        Every university has similar stories. Temporary is permanent, and permanent is temporary. Grand, final-solution buildings obsolesce and have to be torn down because they were too overspecified to their original purpose to adapt easily to anything else. Temporary buildings are thrown up quickly and roughly to house temporary projects. Those projects move on soon enough, but they are immediately supplanted by other temporary projects — of which, it turns out, there is an endless supply.

    <p>
      If every new project ignores the past, no process can absorb emerging themes of a system. The building will always be in a state of chaos. This is the fear of incrementalism — chaos with little meaningful progress. This only happens when we don’t learn from past increments.

        When the height of fashion moves on, they’re the ones left behind, stuck in a building that was designed to look good rather than work well, and now it doesn’t even look good. They spend their day trapped in someone else’s taste, which everyone agrees is bad taste.

      It’s easy, especially in hindsight, to complain about trends. It’s hard, especially ahead of time, to understand the risk of following trends. There aren’t many things as permanent as buildings. They’re aren’t many things as replaceable as clothes. Whatever we’re building, we should assess the risk of following trends accordingly.

      <p>
        Matisse Enzer, a contractor who has worked with [Christopher] Alexander, agrees: “Architects think of a building as a complete thing, while builders think of it and know it as a sequence — hole, then foundation, framing, roof, etc. The separation of design from making has resulted in a built environment that has no ‘flow’ to it — you simply cannot design an improvisation or an adaptation. It’s dead.”

      As we interact the space, we’re likely to better understand how we can improve with the space. If we can’t exploit these realizations as we go, it’s unlikely we’ll build something great. The process of building needs to include the constant flow of new information.

      <p>
        The opposite strategy is much surer, because the errors are piecemeal and correctable. When you proceed deliberately, mistakes don’t cascade, they instruct. Low risk plus time equals high gain. This strategy treats the fundamentals of the living investment with attention and respect. The lesson of realty laced with reality is: “Get rich slow.”

      <p>
        What do the linked debacles of deep office buildings, sealed office buildings, and “smart” office buildings have in common? Each was a clever and comprehensive design solution, but each tried to solve just one primary problem and acted as if the problem would hold still over time. These were classic cases of overspecificity, over centralized control, and “tight fit.” Each took a conspicuous trend of the moment — open offices in the 1960s, energy efficiency in the 1970s, information technology in the 1980s — and, at astronomical cost, shaped whole buildings tightly around it. When the trends moved on, the buildings were left standing, good at something that no one wanted any more. Their failure is the failure of optimization as a design strategy.

      The strategy in these examples cater to an unknown point of satisfaction. Too much of something can be more frustrating than not enough of something. When are we committing too much resources to a strategy at the expense of others? How do we know when to stop? How do we know when to adjust and adapt? We can’t know ahead of time. We need to build in a way that allows us to notice when we cross a threshold. Then have the courage to stop.

        Where a plan is based on prediction, a strategy is designed to encompass unforeseeably changing conditions. A good strategy ensures that, no matter what happens, you always have maneuvering room.

      In complex environments we can prepare, but we can’t plan. For example, we can prepare for rain on a camping trip. Although we can’t know, in any meaningful way, when it will start and end. Will it start before lunch? If so, will it end before dinner? Planning is a helpful mental exercise to account for local conditions. Make plans. Many plans. Use them to simulate what could happen. The goal, however, isn’t to have a plan. The goal is to be prepared.

    <blockquote>

      <p>
        The iron rule of planning is: whatever a client or an architect says will happen with a building, won’t. Architects always want to control the future. So do clients. A big, physical building seems a perfect way to bind the course of future events. (“Once we move the company into the new building, then we can use it to limit our growth.”) It never works. The future is no more controllable than it is predictable. The only reliable attitude to take toward the future is that it is profoundly, structurally, unavoidably perverse. The rest of the iron run is: whatever you are ready for, doesn’t happen; whatever you are unready for, does.

    <p>
      Whenever we build something to control our environment, it creates artificial dependencies. New variables to manage. Planning becomes more complex. When something breaks down, there are more things to consider and manage. There’s more expense. There’s a higher chance of failure.
