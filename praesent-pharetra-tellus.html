    <blockquote>

      <p>
        Almost no buildings adapt well. They’re designed not to adapt; also budgeted and financed not to, constructed not to, administered not to, maintained not to, regulated and taxed not to, even remodeled not to. But all buildings (except monuments) adapt anyway, however poorly, because the usages in and around them are changing constantly.

    <p>
      The dysfunctional process of construction produces maladaptive buildings. It is far less expensive to adapt software to its environment. Unfortunately, without changing how we manage software, it will likely remain rigid. It will likely continue to resist adapting to its environment.
